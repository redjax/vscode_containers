# Visual Studio Code Dev Containers

This will eventually store variations of dev containers I make. Right now it's just a reference for how to set up a repo with a dev container.

## TODO

- [x] Create a cookiecutter
- [x] Create image variations
  - [x] Python
  - [x] Mamba
  - [x] PDM
- [x] Fix init terminal `$ sh`
- [ ] Example `docker-compose.yml`
  - [ ] Variations of `docker-compose.yml` files

## Templates

The [`cookiecutter`](./cookiecutter/) directory has `cookiecutter` templates for various dev container environments. To set up a dev container in a new project using one of these templates, point the cookiecutter command at this repository. For example, to set up a new `.devcontainer` directory in a local repository project using the `standard` template, you would run:

`cookiecutter https://github.com/redjax/vscode_containers --directory="cookiecutter/standard"`

This will create a directory `.devcontainer` with the files from [`./cookiecutter/standard/`](./cookiecutter/standard/) in the directory the `cookiecutter` command was run from. The files will be generated from the `cookiecutter` template, and are ready to use as-is after running the command.
